### Prerequisites

Nothing to install, just make sure that Javascript is allowed on your browser, if the game didn't start or looked a little corrupted.

### How To Examine

* You can also open the feedreaders.js in the jasmine folder to have a look at the code, it has great examples for testing asynchronous functions.
